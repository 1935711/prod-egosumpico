Found out the party is happening in a
week so had to make this really
quickly. Huge thanks to e!ghtbm for
having a blazing fast 2 day
turn-around time for the music. Thanks
to vino for organizing a great party
once again, decrunch rocks! It was a
tough ~100 hours of debugging,
so I hope you'll enjoy it at the very
least.

Thanks to:
- lechu for lending me the capture
card used to record the demo.
- vino for supporting the prod before
and during the party.
- mi≈Çy for the video and audio capture
one hour before deadline.
- epic7000 for helping solve an
elusive rendering bug that I spent way
too long trying to fix myself.
- Everyone at the demo party who
showed support in the final days/hours
before the deadline.
- Everyone out there somewhere on
Earth (and beyond), who are part of
our lovely demoscene community.
